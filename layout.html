      <p>Construction of the large-sized Minekaze-class destroyers was authorized as part of the Imperial Japanese Navy's 8-4 Fleet Program from fiscal 1917–1920, as an accompaniment to the medium-sized Momi class, with which they shared many common design characteristics.[2] Equipped with powerful engines, these vessels were capable of high speeds and were intended as escorts for the projected Amagi-class battlecruisers, which were ultimately never built.[3] Shimakaze, built at the Maizuru Naval Arsenal, was the fourth ship of this class. It was laid down on September 5, 1919, launched on March 31, 1920 and commissioned on November 15, 1920.[4]On completion, Shimakaze was assigned to Yokosuka Naval District as part of Destroyer Division 3 under the IJN 2nd Fleet. On October 11, 1928, in Uraga Channel, while on night training maneuvers, Shimakaze collided with her sister ship Yūkaze, resulting in significant damage to her port side, and requiring extensive repairs.From 1938-1939, Shimakaze was assigned to patrols of the northern and central China coastlines in support of Japanese combat operations in the Second Sino-Japanese War. During the Battle of Shanghai on September 25, 1937, while engaged in operations on the Huangpu River, Shimakaze came under fire from troops of the Chinese National Revolutionary Army, wounding Destroyer Division 3 commanding officer Lieutenant commander Prince Fushimi Hiroyoshi.In December 1938, Destroyer Division 3 was disbanded, and Shimakaze was reassigned to the reserves.</p>
      <p>In April 1940, after extensive modifications, Shimakaze was returned to active duty as a patrol boat, and renamed Patrol Boat No.1 ( 第一号哨戒艇 Dai-ichi-gō Shōkaitei?). These modifications included a reduction in the number of boilers to two, which in turn cut her top speed to 20 knots. The number of Type 3 120 mm guns was likewise reduced from four to two, and all torpedo launchers were removed. In their place, four triple Type 96 25 mm AT/AA Guns were added, as well as 18 depth chargess. The stern of the ship was modified to house two landing crafts, capable of landing 250 naval infantry troops. After the start of the Pacific War, Patrol Boat No.1 was assigned to patrols and escort missions in the Philippines, Netherlands East Indies and Solomon Islands. On January 12, 1943, while escorting the fleet oiler Akebono in the Bismarck Archipelago, she was torpedoed and sunk by the submarine USS Guardfish near Kavieng, New Ireland at position 02°51′S 149°43′ECoordinates: 02°51′S 149°43′E.</p>
